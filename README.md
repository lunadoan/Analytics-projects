# Hello, Welcome to my Analytics Portfolio! <br>
Few things get to see the many sides of me like analysis projects do. There's the goofy, easy-going me, the critical and tough perfectionist, the indecisive thinker, and the determined problem-solver. Each brings out different versions of myself. <br>

What I love about analytics is the challenge of shifting between the big picture and the tiniest details - figuring out if a problem is worth solving, and then diving in to solve it. Whether it's the joy of automation or the grind of manual work to get sh*t done, I enjoy every single moment.

Welcome!

## 1. Causal Inference

### 1.1 Causal inference when randomization (A/B testing) is feasible
Example: testing one-click autopayment enrollment feature on conversion and retention

### 1.2 Causal inference when randomization (A/B testing) is not feasible
Example: testing promotion effect on revenue during Xmas season

Why not randomize (for the sake of simplicity)?
- It's costly to run experiments
- It's unethical to run experiments
- Spliting user groups introduces bias

#### For Fun: **Spurious causation is everywhere** 

If it weren't margarine sales and divorce, but app downloads and views after new page layout launch, would you assume the new release cause the drop in downloads? <br>

Another good example, an article from Washington Post <br>

*And oh, reverse direction somehow... also makes sense* <br>
