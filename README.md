# Hello, Welcome to my Analytics Portfolio! <br>
Few things get to see the many sides of me like analysis projects do. There's the goofy, easy-going me, the critical and tough perfectionist, the indecisive thinker, and the determined problem-solver. Each brings out different versions of myself. <br>

What I love about analytics is the challenge of shifting between the big picture and the tiniest details - figuring out if a problem is worth solving, and then diving in to solve it. Whether it's the joy of automation or the grind of manual work to get sh*t done, I enjoy every single moment.

Welcome!

## 1. Causal Inference

### 1.1 Causal inference when randomization (A/B testing) is feasible
Example: testing one-click autopayment enrollment feature on conversion and retention

### 1.2 Causal inference when randomization (A/B testing) is not feasible
Example: testing promotion effect on revenue during Xmas season

Why not randomize (for the sake of simplicity)?
- It's costly to run experiment
- It's unethical 
- Spliting user groups introduces bias

#### Just for fun: Why I'm so interested in causal analysis? 

Take a look at this, causation or correlation? <br>

If it weren't margarine sales and divorce, but app downloads and views after new page layout launch, would you assume the new release cause the drop in downloads?

Another good example, an article from Washington Post <br>

*And oh, reverse direction works as well* <br>

**Spurious causation is everywhere** And that's why I'm interested in causal inference!

## 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 2.1. Data job market analysis 

### 2.2. Customer feedback analysis
